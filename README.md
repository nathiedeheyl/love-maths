### Notes / Improvements 

I personally think there's a media query for tablets missing. At least in my Chrome browser the design lacks responsiveness. 

### Learnings 

- About button data-type property 
- Writing out a structure of functions: function() {} !! The curly brackets are important, otherwise the code will produce an error and not load correctly.
